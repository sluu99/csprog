Programming with C#
=====

This class aims to teach programming to folks without computer science background. Even though the class uses C#,
the majority of the concepts covered in each lesson are applicable to other languages as well.

### Lessons:

1. [The Basics](01-the-basics.md): console input, output; data types; variables; numeric arithmetic.
2. Decision Making: think like a programmer with flow-charts; if-else statements; switch statements; code comments.
3. Debugging & Exercises: debugging with Visual Studio; exercises.
4. Loops: while loops; for loops.
5. Functions: declaring and calling functions; function parameters.
6. Arrays: one dimensional arrays.
7. Sorting: bubble sort.

### Why C#?
It was a hard choice when I had to decide on what language to use for teaching programming, but at the end I belive C# is the right choice. The reasons are:

* C# is a relatively clean language. I was also considering Python for its readability, but didn't want newcomers to have to deal with the intepreter freaking out on white-spaces vs tabs indentation.
* C# is a static-typed and strongly-typed language. I want to cover data types in this class as well as having the compiler aids the students when dealing with variables.
* I plan to create cool UI for class exercises where the students only have to implement the logic. Using C# would be a lot easier than having to setup GLUT or Tk.

### C# limitations: 
While I believe C# is a good choice for beginners to learn programming with, it is not without limitations. The biggest one would be its ability to run on non-Windows platforms. While the [Mono project](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page) and [MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com/) are two very great tools, the lessons are currently using Visual Studio Express 2012. If this class is taught a second time, it is possible that Mono and MonoDevelop instructions will be included.
